When we came back south on the Dempster, there were a few moments where it was like all of a sudden we could see a great viewpoint that had been covered with fog on the way north, or we came down a hill that I hadn’t realized was as steep as it was when I climbed it. That kind of familiarity mixed with newness. Coming east on the Alaska Highway was a lot like that. We stopped in the warm lodge at Rancheria. We drove past the abandoned buildings of Swift River. We passed that hill where the guy gave me a diet Pepsi.

We stopped at the Teslin Tlingit Heritage Centre, where I took these photos. I talked to a tanner about skills-based learning and the tradition of Elders passing on their culture, and a member of the Raven Clan. This banner and totem are the Yanyeidí (Wolf) Clan. I stopped at the Teslin Tlingit Council as well and got contact information for a local biologist working on rehabilitating the salmon population.

It was a good day, but it’s still kind of strange travelling with an engine. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the feeling of muscle-speed transportation.
