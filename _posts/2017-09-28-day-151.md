Not a lot to report from today. I spent the morning at the Museum at Campbell River and spent the afternoon at the local library. Learning about local history, catching up on some past logs and emails. The museum was beautifully arranged. The library had skylights. One of my hosts from where I’d spent the night, Jannie, told me my helmet strap was too loose.

I’ll finish with a visual that I captured at the library, which I’m going to use in a long-form article about smallpox and disease on Haida Gwaii and elsewhere in the colonization of what is now called British Columbia. That’s going to be a big piece of research so I’m happy to have made headway on one small part of it. Also it gives an idea of the quality of the museum, which I found to be pretty remarkable for a local institution.
