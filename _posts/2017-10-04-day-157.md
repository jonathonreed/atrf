I started the day about 30 km north of Nanaimo. Stopped in Chemainus for lunch and an exploration of the town’s history through its murals. Ended up talking to a busker and had to bike quickly to Crofton where I caught the ferry with about five minutes to spare. Made it after a bit of a delay to my host’s place on sunny Salt Spring Island. After a while, we drove up to a beach to watch the sunset. The kids and I tossed pinecones at each other and attempted to skip ocean stones. We balanced on the log and tried tasting seaweed. The sun went down but the horizon glowed orange for the entire drive back inland.

“So, what lake is this?” I asked.

The kids stared at me. “It’s not a lake.”

“Yeah, but what’s it called?”

“The Salish Sea,” they said.

“No, I mean what’s the lake called?”

“It’s not a lake!”

(And so on.)

This is my final stopping point before I call it in Vancouver. Seems like a good place.
