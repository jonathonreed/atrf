Well, I food poisoned myself. So the last couple days have been pretty tough. I’m as grateful as you could imagine for the fact that I’m sick while with some loving people and close friends, in a beautiful place on the Gulf Islands. I definitely wouldn’t want to feel like this alone in a tent. Or on a bicycle. Anyway, kids as always are great medicine and I perked up a bit around sunset exploring the southeastern coast of the island with them, climbing on trees and throwing rocks in the water.

Other than that my mission today was to drink as much water as I could handle. Headed to Vancouver tomorrow.
