I already mentioned the Dempster Highway in the log entry for <a href="http://jonathonreed.com/atrf/2017/08/31/days-119-123/">days 119-123</a>, but I'm reposting it under the places category so it can be found more easily. I described the adventure cycling 800 km of Arctic gravel road in <a href="https://jonathonreed.exposure.co/cycling-to-the-arctic/">the Exposure story</a>. I also researched <a href="http://jonathonreed.com/atrf/2017/09/30/every-child-matters/">residential schooling in the north</a>, interviewed <a href="http://jonathonreed.com/atrf/2017/11/16/david-trapper/">a Gwichâ€™in trapper</a> and <a href="http://jonathonreed.com/atrf/2017/09/15/on-the-arctic-ocean/">photographed the Arctic Ocean</a>.

Making it to the Arctic was one of the most challenging logistical elements of the route across the country, as well as one of the most grueling sections to ride, but I don't regret it for a second.
